# Train Timetable Scheduler

This is a database-backed list of trains and their timetables. You can
enter a train name, destination, first train time and frequency, and it
will calculate when the next train is due to arrive and how many minutes
away it is.

Currently you can only add to the database, not delete or modify entries.
